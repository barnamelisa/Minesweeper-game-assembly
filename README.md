## 📌 About  

This project is an **Assembly-based** implementation of **Minesweeper**, a logic puzzle game where the player must uncover tiles on a grid while avoiding hidden mines.  

The goal of the game is to uncover all safe tiles without detonating any mines. If a mine is revealed, the game is over! 🚀  

### Core Functionalities:  
- Console-based UI with keyboard input  
- Randomly generated minefield  
- Player movement and tile uncovering  
- Win/Loss detection  
- Number hints to indicate nearby mines

## 🚀 Features  

✔️ **Grid-based game logic** similar to the original Minesweeper  
✔️ **Random mine generation** at the start of each game  
✔️ **Hint numbers** to indicate adjacent mines  
✔️ **Win/Loss conditions** implemented

## 🎮 How to Play  

1. Start the game, and a grid with hidden mines will be generated.  
2. Use **arrow keys** to move the cursor around the grid.  
3. Press **Enter** to uncover a tile:  
   - If it's a number, it indicates how many mines are adjacent.  
   - If it's empty, it means no mines are nearby.  
   - If it's a mine, **Game Over!** ☠️  
4. **Flag potential mines** (if implemented).  
5. **Win the game** by uncovering all non-mine tiles! 🎉
